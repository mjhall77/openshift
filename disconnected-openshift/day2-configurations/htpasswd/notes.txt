# Using htpasswd authentication in OpenShift Container Platform allows you to identify users based on an htpasswd file. 
# An htpasswd file is a flat file that contains the user name and hashed password for each user. 
# You can use the htpasswd utility to create this file.

# NOTE: With a default installation, self-provisioning is enabled with a ClusterRoleBinding that maps the self-provisioner role to a virtual group that represents authenticated users. 
#       Users added with htpasswd will by default will be able to log into the cluster and create a project
#       Since all users authenticated with oauth are automatically included in the system:authenticated: oauth virtual group, you will need can remove that role-binding. 
#       However, then nobody will automatically get the self-provisioner role


# htpasswd requires httpd-tools package to be installed

# Create htpasswd   
# NOTE: adding the -c flag will create the file, if a file already exists it will overwrite it 
htpasswd -c -B </path/to/file> <username>

# Update htpasswd
htpasswd -B </path/to/file> <username>

# Create an openshift secret in the openshift-config namespace for the htpasswd file
oc create secret generic htpass-secret --from-file=htpasswd=/path/to/htpasswd -n openshift-config

# Add indentity provider to the cluster by applying htpasswd-config.yaml 
oc apply -f htpasswd-config.yaml -n openshift-config

# Wait for new pods to deploy in openshift-authentication
oc get po -n openshift-authentication -o wide
