# Out of the box, OpenShift does not restrict the quantity of objects or amount of resources (eg: CPU, memory) that they can consume within a Project. Further, users may create an unlimited number of Projects. 

# View the built in defualt project template: 
oc adm create-bootstrap-project-template -o yaml

# Templates are a powerful tool that enable the user to easily create reusable sets of OpenShift objects with powerful parameterization. 
# While the quota sets an upper bound on the total resource consumption within a project, the LimitRange generally applies to individual resources. For example, setting how much CPU an individual Pod or container can use.
# Remember that quotas and limits are applied at the Project level. Users may have access to multiple Projects, but quotas and limits do not apply directly to Users. 
# If you want to apply one quota across multiple Projects, then you should look at the multi-project quota documentation

# To create a project template that you want to use cluster wide:
oc create -f project_quota_ranges_template.yaml -n openshift-config

# The default projectRequestTemplate is part of the OpenShift API Server configuration. This configuration is ultimately stored in a ConfigMap in the openshift-apiserver project
oc get cm config -n openshift-apiserver

# To add the project-request template apply the following:
oc apply -f cr_project_request.yaml

# It will take some time to update openshift api server configurations:
oc rollout status deploy apiserver -n openshift-apiserver

# To verify confirgation has been implemented, see projectRequestTemplate section:
oc get cm config -n openshift-apiserver -o jsonpath --template="{.data.config\.yaml}" | jq

# To test create a test project
oc new-project template-test

# Verify quotas are set
oc describe project template-test

oc get quota 

oc describe quota template-test-quota

oc get limitranges

oc describe limitranges template-test-limits
