# OpenShift Container Platform Compliance Operator (CO) runs compliance scans and provides remediations to assist users in meeting compliance standards

# rule.compliance is a single compliance check. For example the rule rhcos4-service-auditd-enabled checks if the auditd daemon is running on RHCOS.
# profile.compliance is a collection of rules that form a single compliance baseline for a product. 
# profilebundle.compliance is a collection of profiles for a single product where product might be ocp4 or rhcos4.


----------------------------- build a scan --------------------------------------------
# Get a list of profiles.compliance
oc get profiles.compliance.openshift.io -n openshift-compliance  

# View the profile and list of rules 
oc describe profiles.compliance.openshift.io rhcos4-stig-v2r1 -n openshift-compliance

# View the profile bundles
oc get profilebundles.compliance.openshift.io -n openshift-compliance

# View contents of a rule
oc get rule.compliance rhcos4-accounts-no-uid-except-zero -nopenshift-compliance -oyaml

# Create Scan settings by applying the yaml file.  There are two important pieces of a ScanSettingBinding object:
# profiles: Contains a list of (name,kind,apiGroup) tuples that make up a selection of the Profile (or a TailoredProfile that we will explain later) to scan your environment with.
# settingsRef: A reference to a ScanSetting object also using the (name,kind,apiGroup) tuple that references the operational constraints.
oc apply -f stig-scan-setting-binding.yaml -n openshift-compliance
oc apply -f stig-scan-setting.yaml -n openshift-compliance

# View progress of scans - depending on number of profiles and nodes it could take some time for the scans to complete
oc get compliancesuites.compliance.openshift.io -n openshift-compliance
oc get compliancescans.compliance.openshift.io -n openshift-compliance

# View the checks that are not compliance with the rule
oc get compliancecheckresults.compliance.openshift.io -n openshift-compliance

# View the remediations for the rules that did not pass the check
oc get complianceremediations.compliance.openshift.io -n openshift-compliance

# Apply remediations -> This will cause the MachineConfig operoatr to create an object and do a rolling reboot all imapacted nodes
$ oc patch complianceremediations rhcos4-e8-worker-sysctl-kernel-dmesg-restrict -p '{"spec":{"apply":true}}' --type=merge

# To apply multiple remediaitons you will need to pause the MachineConfigPool -> Do not forget to unpause
$ oc patch machineconfigpools worker -p '{"spec":{"paused":true}}' --type=merge

------------------------ pull the reports -------------------------

# To retrieve the scan results.  Define and spawn a pod that mounts the PVC and sleeps, 
# then copy the files out of the PVC to a local filesystem.
oc apply -f pv-extract.yaml -n openshift-compliance

# Extract the scan results
oc cp pv-extract:/master-scan-results ./extract_results_dir -n openshift-compliance

# Delete the pv-extract pod due it mounting the pv
oc delete pod pv-extract
