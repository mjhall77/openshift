# The Cluster Version Operator (CVO) is the primary component that orchestrates and facilitates the OpenShift Container Platform update process. 
# During installation and standard cluster operation, the CVO is constantly comparing the manifests of managed cluster Operators to in-cluster 
# resources, and reconciling discrepancies to ensure that the actual state of these resources match their desired state.

# From the oc-mirror-workspace/results-<number> folder for the lastest image content ingest run the following
oc apply -f imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml
oc apply -f catalogSource-cs-redhat-operator-index.yaml     # Note if additional catalog sources apply them as well
oc apply -f release-signatures/

# Deploy the update service operator from the gui and keep the defaults
